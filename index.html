                <p>Star Wars: A New Hope is the first movie in the franchise, introducing audiences to a galaxy far, far away. Despite its 
                    release in 1977, its groundbreaking special effects and storytelling remain impressive today. The movie follows Luke Skywalker 
                    as he embarks on an epic journey to become a Jedi and fight against the Empire.</p>

                <p>My personal favorite, this movie features the legendary duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan. Anakin is the main character, and we get to follow
